The brain tumor detection project combines traditional machine learning models (such as SVM,
Random Forest, KNN, etc.). Using MRI images, the system aims to identify brain tumors early,
enhancing patient outcomes. The project includes preprocessing techniques, evaluation metrics.
We also used the “Ensembling of Models” technique to improve the performance of models and
their accuracy.
